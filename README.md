# Travel First
Travel First is a community-driven travel guide which allows users to discover and share interesting places around the world.

## How to run
1. Install project dependencies with `bundle install`
2. Initialize database with `bundle exec rails db:setup`
3. Run server with `bundle exec rails server`

## How to develop
* Clone [GitHub repository](https://github.com/filip373/Travel-First) to get the codebase
* Join [Waffle](https://waffle.io/filip373/Travel-First/join) to track GitHub issues
* Run tests with `bundle exec rspec`
* Start Guard with `bundle exec guard`
* Develop on your branch and create a Pull Request when you're done ([recommended workflow](https://github.com/waffleio/waffle.io/wiki/Recommended-Workflow-Using-Pull-Requests-&-Automatic-Work-Tracking))
* Once you get positive code review from other contributor, merge your Pull Request and remove your branch

## How it works
* Ruby `2.3.1` and Rails `5.0.0`
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org) for database
* [Rubocop](http://rubocop.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for static code analysis
* [Pry](http://pryrepl.org/) for debugging
* [RSpec](http://rspec.info/) and [Capybara](http://jnicklas.github.io/capybara/) for testing
* [SimpleCov](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov) for code coverage
* [Guard](http://guardgem.org/) for tasks automation
